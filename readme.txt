Matlab code of the Morotti et al. model of rabbit ventricular myocyte with updated ICaL formulation

This model was developed integrating a modified version of the L-type Ca current (LTCC) model by Mahajan et al.
(Biophys J. 2008 Jan 15;94(2):392 -410) into the framework of the Shannon-Bers rabbit ventricular model
(Biophys J. 2004 Nov;87(5):3351-71, available for download in this website).
The LTCC model was extended to reflect more faithfully contributions of Ca- and voltage-dependent inactivation
(CDI and VDI) to total inactivation.
